# CreatePdf

Coding sample for evaluation.

Trying to do this using TDD in four hours felt too tight, so I decided to include a simple test harness just to show how I would do it. as a rule, I tend to prefer writing unit tests after the development, anyway. If you want me to carry on, I am happy to do so, btu I am trying to show you what I can do in the four hours that you gave me.

Some other assumptions that I made or decisions that I took on-the-fly aremay be found in the method PdfBuilder.Builder.Create(). Other comments are scattered through the code.
